This implementation:

Dynamically discovers fields in incoming messages and creates lines for them
Keeps everything accessible through Backtrader's standard .lines interface
Handles various message formats by only updating fields that are present

Here's how an agent would use this in practice:

```python
class Agent(bt.Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        # Standard initialization
        pass
        
    def next(self):
        for data in self.datas:
            # Access standard OHLCV data
            current_close = data.close[0]
            
            # Access dynamic fields that were in the message
            if hasattr(data.lines, 'sentiment_score'):
                sentiment = data.sentiment_score[0]
                print(f"Sentiment for {data._name}: {sentiment}")
            
            if hasattr(data.lines, 'rsi'):
                rsi = data.rsi[0]
                print(f"RSI for {data._name}: {rsi}")
                
            # Trading logic based on all available data...
```

Advanced Usage: Publishing Rich Market Data
To fully leverage this flexible data feed, publish messages with additional fields:

```python
# Example: Publishing enriched market data
publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, topic_name)

# Rich bar data with additional metrics
enriched_data = {
    'timestamp': '2023-04-10T14:30:00Z',
    'open': 150.25,
    'high': 151.50,
    'low': 149.75,
    'close': 151.25,
    'volume': 10000,
    # Additional fields automatically available to the agent:
    'rsi': 65.8,
    'macd': 0.75,
    'bollinger_upper': 152.40,
    'bollinger_lower': 148.60,
    'sentiment_score': 0.65,
    'market_cap': 2450000000000,
    'sector_performance': 0.8
}

publisher.publish(
    topic_path, 
    json.dumps(enriched_data).encode('utf-8'),
    symbol='AAPL'  # Add symbol as an attribute for filtering
)
```

The beauty of this approach is its simplicity and flexibility. Your agent automatically gets access to whatever fields you include in your messages without requiring any code changes. This creates a clean separation between data providers and consumers while maintaining Backtrader's familiar access patterns.
